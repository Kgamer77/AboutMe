                My name is Kevin Clark. I graduated from <a href="https://www.csusb.edu/">California State University San Bernardino</a> with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I've been interested in Computer Science since grade school and have always liked the problem solving aspect of developing applications. I started off learning Python in highschool then Java and have gone on to learn C, C++, C#, and JavaScript in college.
